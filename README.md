# Building a Retail Data Pipeline

![walmartecomm](walmartecomm.jpg)

Walmart is the biggest retail store in the United States. Just like others, they have been expanding their e-commerce part of the business. By the end of 2022, e-commerce represented a roaring $80 billion in sales, which is 13% of total sales of Walmart. One of the main factors that affects their sales is public holidays, like the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. 

In this project, you have been tasked with creating a data pipeline for the analysis of supply and demand around the holidays, along with conducting a preliminary analysis of the data. You will be working with two data sources: grocery sales and complementary data. You have been provided with the `grocery_sales` table in `PostgreSQL` database with the following features:

# `Task`
1. Implement a function named transform() with one argument, taking merged_df as input, filling missing numerical values (using any method of your choice), adding a column "Month", keeping the rows where the weekly sales are over $10,000 and drops the unnecessary columns. Ultimately, it should return a DataFrame and be stored as the clean_data variable.

2. Implement the function avg_weekly_sales_per_month with one argument (the cleaned data). This function will calculate the average monthly sales. For implementing this function you must select the "Month" and "Weekly_Sales" columns as they are the only ones needed for this analysis, then create a chain operation with groupby(), agg(), reset_index(), and round() functions, then group by the "Month" column and calculate the average monthly sales, then call reset_index() to start a new index order and finally round the results to two decimal places.

3. Create a function called load() that takes the cleaned and aggregated DataFrames, and their paths, and saves them as clean_data.csv and agg_data.csv respectively, without an index.

4. Lastly, define a validation() function that checks whether the two csv files from the load() exist in the current working directory.  

# `grocery_sales`
- `"index"` - unique ID of the row
- `"Store_ID"` - the store number
- `"Date"` - the week of sales
- `"Weekly_Sales"` - sales for the given store

Also, you have the `extra_data.parquet` file that contains complementary data:

# `extra_data.parquet`
- `"IsHoliday"` - Whether the week contains a public holiday - 1 if yes, 0 if no.
- `"Temperature"` - Temperature on the day of sale
- `"Fuel_Price"` - Cost of fuel in the region
- `"CPI"` â€“ Prevailing consumer price index
- `"Unemployment"` - The prevailing unemployment rate
- `"MarkDown1"`, `"MarkDown2"`, `"MarkDown3"`, `"MarkDown4"` - number of promotional markdowns
- `"Dept"` - Department Number in each store
- `"Size"` - size of the store
- `"Type"` - type of the store (depends on `Size` column)

You will need to merge those files and perform some data manipulations. The transformed DataFrame can then be stored as the `clean_data` variable containing the following columns:
- `"Store_ID"`
- `"Month"`
- `"Dept"`
- `"IsHoliday"`
- `"Weekly_Sales"`
- `"CPI"`
- "`"Unemployment"`"

After merging and cleaning the data, you will have to analyze monthly sales of Walmart and store the results of your analysis as the `agg_data` variable that should look like:

|  Month | Weekly_Sales  | 
|---|---|
| 1.0  |  33174.178494 |
|  2.0 |  34333.326579 |
|  ... | ...  |  

Finally, you should save the `clean_data` and `agg_data` as the csv files.

It is recommended to use `pandas` for this project.
